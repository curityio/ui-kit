# Getting Started

## Login

The package is published in the Curity npm registry. You need to authenticate to be able to install it.

```shell
curity-cli login
```

You need to install `curity-cli` from Kandji.

## Install

Create a `.npmrc` in the project root

```shell
registry=https://hub.curityio.net/repository/curity-npm-group/
```

### Install the package as a dependency

```shell
npm install @curity-internal/css
```

## How to use the CSS library

In most modern JS tooling and frameworks or when using a separate bundler, you can import the CSS directly from `node_modules` like this:

```js
import "@curity-internal/css/dist/index.css";
```

You can also just reference this file in HTML `<link>` tag.
