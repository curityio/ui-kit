# Toast

Curity Toast can be used, it's a vanilla JavaScript implementation. You can use it to show notifications to the user.
It's being used in the Curity Admin UI and DevOps Dashboard, and OAuth Tools

[View Repo](https://bitbucket.org/curity/curity-toast/src/master/)

```shell
npm install --production @curity-internal/toast
```

For newer React projects we can use [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/) and style as is our own
